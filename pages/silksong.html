			<h1> Silksong </h1>
			<section>
				<p> Silksong is the second game made by Team Cherry. It took them 7 YEARS to make, and everyone went crazy when they announced the release date, which was on september 4.</p>
				<h4> Here are some facts about the game: </h4>
				<ul>
					<li> You play as Hornet from the first game Hollow Knight </li>
					<li> The game definitly shares the same DNA as the original, but it's more polished and improved. </li>
					<li> It is a lot harder because of the nature of Hornets mouvement and the setting in general is more fast paced. </li>
				</ul>
